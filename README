Console application manager for linux like dmenu; supports search and
3 output modes, very fast. For compilation you just need to run Makefile
in the root folder, i.e. in the folder with sapps.cc.

1. Line mode for one line search:

  loaded 12304 files from 6 paths (3.23 GiB)
  : firefox 2

2. Long mode for searching in multiple lines:

  ...,
  zipinfo
  zmf2raw
  zmf2svg
  717: f

3. Random mode to select a random mode from the {line, long} set:

   ????
   ????

To set it in i3 you can make a bind like this,
  bindsym $<key> exec --no-startup-id <your terminal> <path to sapps> <mode>.

For example, I have it set like this,
  bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id kitty /home/lomaster/sapps/sapps long
