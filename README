Console application manager for linux like dmenu; supports search and
3 output modes, very fast. For compilation you just need to run Makefile
in the root folder, i.e. in the folder with aelist.c.

! The ncurses library is required for compilation.

1. (-l) Line mode for one line search:

  : firef

2. (-L) Long mode for searching in multiple lines:

  loaded 11608 files from 6 paths (2.95 GiB)
  exec /usr/sbin/firefox (45.00 B) 4
  : firef
  ------------------------------------
  zipinfo
  zmf2raw
  zmf2svg
  ...,

3. (-s) Short mode is the same as long mode, only without the prompts:

  loaded 11608 files from 6 paths (2.95 GiB)
  exec /usr/sbin/firefox (45.00 B) 4
  : firef

4. (-r) Random mode to select a random mode from the {line, long} set:

  ????
  ????

Examples run,
	./aelist -L /bin /usr/bin /sbin
	./aelist -L -n 100 /bin /usr/bin /sbin
	./aelist -s -S /bin /usr/bin /sbin
	./aelist -r /bin /usr/bin /sbin
	./aelist -l /bin /usr/bin /sbin

For example, my i3 settings were as follows:
	bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id kitty /home/lomaster/aelist/aelist -L /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin
